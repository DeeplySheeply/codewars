# codewarsCsharp

This folder contains solutions to challenges posted on the CodeWars website. All challenges are in C#. 

There are 11 difficulty levels in CodeWars. The easiest starts at 8. I move from 8Kyu  to 1 Kyu. Then from 1 Dan to the hardest 4 Dan. 

Each class in this folder will be named with the class name from CodeWars and the Kyu level at the end. i.e class Fixer of 8 Kyu will be labelled Fixer8
